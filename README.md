# RegexpWidth (Work In Progess)
This is a software to compute the width of a given regular expression or NFA.

NOTICE: This repository is a work in progress and could contains some bugs that are currently being addressed.

## Regular expression
To take a regular expression as input it's needed to specify the flag -REG.

The tool work as follow:
1. Compute the Glushkov automaton of the input Regexp
2. Compute the colex partial preoder of the Glushkov automaton <cite>[1]</cite>
3. Compute the chain decomposition of the colex partial order <cite>[2]</cite>

The regexp is read from the standard input stream and should be written all in a single line

Supported regexp operators: ()+?|*
The operators have the following syntax:
- "+": is a unary operator, specifies that the preceding character or group of characters 
must appear one or more times.
- "?": is a unary operator, specifies that the preceding character or group of characters is 
optional. It matches either zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
- "|": is a binary operator. It functions as a logical OR, allowing you to match either the 
pattern on the left-hand side of the | or the pattern on the right-hand side.
- "*": is a unary operator. It specifies that the preceding character or group of characters 
can occur zero or more times. 

Optional flags:
```
-chain FILE         Store the chain decomposition of the 
                    partial preorder in the file specified in
                    the the following format:     
                        -in the first line we have the number of chains
                        -in the following lines we have the chains

-partial FILE       Store the partial preorder as a Hasse
                    diagram in the following format:
                        -in the first line we have the number of nodes
                         and number of edges
                        -in the following lines we have the edges
                        
-gl FILE            Save the Glushkov automaton in 
                    the specified file as a dot format file.

-quotient FILE      Store the quotient graph obtained 
                    by collapsing the equivalent class defined 
                    by the partial preorder as a dot format file

-verificator        Check if the algorithm works correctly 
                    and if the given order is partial and 
                    co-lexicographic.
```

### Output 

This tool prints some statistics about the regexp:

* The regex length
* The number of times the symbol "+" appears in the regexp.
* The number of times the symbol "?" appears in the regexp.
* The number of times the symbol "|" appears in the regexp.
* The number of times the symbol "*" appears in the regexp. 

It also prints some statistics about the colex Partial order, the Glushkov automaton and the quotient graph:

* The width of the partial order
* The number of nodes and edges of the Glushkov automaton
* The number of nodes and edges of the quotient graph

## NFA
To take a regular expression as input it's needed to specify the flag -NFA.

The tool work as follow:
1. Compute the colex partial preoder of the automaton <cite>[1]</cite>
2. Compute the chain decomposition of the colex partial order <cite>[2]</cite>

The NFA is read from the standard input stream and should be written all in a .DOT file style.

### NFA example

```
digraph example { 
    0 -> 1 [ label = " a b " ];
    0 -> 2 [ label = " ab " ];
    2 -> 4 [ label = " cd cs " ];
    3 -> 5 [ label = " a b " ];
    1 -> 3 [ label = " ab " ];
}
```

The format is a digraph, the nodes should be numbered from 0 to n. The label are strings inside two brackets and there must be a space at the beginning and one at the end of the label, as in the example.

Optional flags:
```
-chain FILE         Store the chain decomposition of the 
                    partial preorder in the file specified in
                    the the following format:     
                        -in the first line we have the number of chains
                        -in the following lines we have the chains

-partial FILE       Store the partial preorder as a Hasse
                    diagram in the following format:
                        -in the first line we have the number of nodes
                         and number of edges
                        -in the following lines we have the edges

-quotient FILE      Store the quotient graph obtained 
                    by collapsing the equivalent class defined 
                    by the partial preorder as a dot format file

-verificator        Check if the algorithm works correctly 
                    and if the given order is partial and 
                    co-lexicographic.
```

### Output 

The tools prints some statistics about the colex Partial order, the Glushkov automaton and the quotient graph:

* The width of the partial order
* The number of nodes and edges of the original automaton
* The number of nodes and edges of the quotient graph

### Requirements

This tool requires:
* A modern C++17 compiler.
